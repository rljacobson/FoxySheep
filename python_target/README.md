# FoxySheep Python2 Target

This is the Python target of FoxySheep. Files generated by ANTLR4 are assumed to be in a subdirectory called `generated` containing an empty `__init__.py` file. See the Makefile for details.

## FoxySheepLexer Must Subclass Lexer

In order for the generated lexer to subclass our lexer base class, we have to _manually_ add the following lines to the generated lexer, `generated/FoxySheepLexer.py`:
```python
from generated.FoxySheepParser import FoxySheepParser
from FoxySheep.Lexer import Lexer
```
Of course, we don't actually do this manually. Instead we do some bash magic:
```bash
cat FoxySheep/LexerPreface.py generated/FoxySheepLexer.py > tmp.py && mv tmp.py generated/FoxySheepLexer.py
```
