* The checkNewline function sets HIDDEN. Is this right? Are newlines treated correctly?

* Getters and setters in Python are missing. Use properties and getter/setter decorators for: setType, setChannel, _token?

* PyCharm incorrectly complains about:
```python
from typing.io import TextIO
```
However, this isn't an error.
